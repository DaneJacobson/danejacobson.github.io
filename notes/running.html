        <h2>Half Marathon PR Progression:</h2>
        <p><strong>17-08-2024:</strong> <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12170432900">1h44m12s</a></p>

        <p><strong>05-07-2024:</strong> <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11817971734">2h18m</a></p>
        <p>
            Here's a stupid story: one Friday at 6PM, on 4 hours of sleep, no 
            food, no water just coffee, no training 
            and angry for having done absolutely 
            no work, I went on a run. I was so pissed, that 3 minutes into the run 
            I decided "hey! I should run a marathon! In a loop! In the woods!"
        </p>

        <p>
            8 miles later, I realized there was a 0% chance that I would make it 26.2 miles
            and opted for a half marathon: 13.1 miles. I somehow made it, 
            completing the half marathon in 2 hours and 18 minutes. 1 standard deviation 
            to the right for men. I'll take it for no training...
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I noticed something strange. I felt <strong>good</strong>.
            And the dopamine high
            didn't leave for 3 days. <strong>3 ENTIRE DAYS</strong>. Specifically, I was a monster 
            at work, putting in 16 hour days of focus without breaking a sweat. 
            I don't think I've ever been that productive without Princeton's Dean's 
            Date looming over my head.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, even though I don't like running, I think I'm obligated to try it 
            because I think I just found a cheat code to life and I must listen to
            my body. 
            I'm starting this logbook to 
            document my progression. I have no goal except
            to optimize my best half marathon time. As always, this logbook will be 
            in <strong>reverse chronological order</strong> so you don't need to scroll
            through my yapping to see how I'm doing. Let's do it!

        <p>
            BOOM! Half-marathon in 01:44:12.
            <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/12170432900">
                Einstein said Mendelsohn was ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù. Mendy, fuck that noise, this PR is for you.
            </a>
            Because I was leaving for 
            <a href="https://www.threemileislandcamp.org/">3 Mile Island</a>
            that day, I half-assed my cooldown, and didn't rest properly. I tweaked my right knee walking 
            down a flight of stairs post-run. Need to ensure that my warm-up and cool-down is emphasized.
            Regardless, I maintained 
            a roughly 7:50 min/mi pace. To achieve a 1:35:00 PR, I need to run a sub 7:15 min/mi pace.
            The first step is to understand what running at a 7:00 min/mi pace feels like, so the next 
            steps are to increase my default run distance and scope out what 7:00 min/mi pace feels 
            like. Additionally, strength, stability, and flexibility training for my knees is required.
            Finally, I need to learn how to eat A LOT. This is likely the hardest improvement.
        </p>

                Paced at what felt like a "slow" speed, which was 7:30. The key was "bouncing". Seems 
                that I'm ready for my sub 1:45:00 attempt on Friday. Just need to bounce.

                Flight at 4. Tried to absurdly pace myself and overshot. Need to learn what 8:00 min/mile 
                pace feels like so I can maintain it for the first 6.5 miles of the half and then take off
                for the second half.

                    Be careful not to immanentize the eschaton</a>. 
                Need to learn to pace. Friend recommended "consciously mentally affirming how easy I feel 
                at the beginning" and to "tap into my reserves" at the end. I'm gunning 
                for a sub 1:45 run requiring an 8:00 pace, so it would behoove me to practice running 
                at 8:00 until halfway and then turning up the heat. I also ran with music and 
                it was motivating, but it's not allowed during some official races. I'm not 
                planning on racing ever (I run for myself) but it would be a shame to be dependent. 
                No music next run.

                Ow. Felt like crap before my run, felt like crap during the run. New default distance 
                of 5.77 miles - extended the Bong Run up Heartbreak Hill and back again. Should run 
                with my brother more, kid's got pace.

                Hit a bong run PR just by lengthening my stride 
                when I get tired. Should lengthen my default distance for better pacing practice. 
                Goodbye bong run. For now.

            13.26 miles in 01:54.
            <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11995083307">This PR brought to you by a ü•• üå¥</a>. 
            I ran calculations on dew point+body->outside temperature delta+energy 
            flux and found I would expend 10-15% less energy had I started my run at 5AM 
            when it was 70¬∞F, instead of at 10AM, when it was 83¬∞F. I 
            don't think pacing is as important. Other notes: food ran out around mile 9, and it hit
            like a freight train. Need more carbs the day before, maybe more water before the run. Otherwise,
            I might incorporate some deadlifts/pulls/abs Sunday and Wednesday to strengthen my posterior 
            chain - I slouch towards the end of my runs. That's all, I'm guessing sub 1:45 with the right 
            timing, more food, more water, and a stronger back. We will handle pacing another day.

        <h2>26-07-2024: Thursday</h2>
        <p>
            Quick summary to explain where I'm at, and I'll be less wordy from here on out. 
            Few weeks of chill running, logging
            25 miles total since that run. I do this 4.2 mile run I call the "bong run"
            every once in a while. I've realized a couple crucial things about pacing
            and easing into a run so you're not fighting cold muscles. I'm attempting
            another halfie on Saturday after resting Friday, hopefully hitting sub 
            2 hours. The only adjustments I need to make to improve are: get sleep,
            hydrate, eat food the night before, and pace myself at sub 9:16 min/mi. 
            Can't believe Trump was almost assassinated, and also Kamala is the Dem
            nominee! Insanity right now. But I have no time to witness history: I'm 
            running too fast to notice hehe
