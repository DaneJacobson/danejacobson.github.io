        <h2>Half Marathon PR Progression:</h2>
        <p><strong>27-07-2024:</strong> <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11995083307">1h54m</a></p> 
        <p><strong>05-07-2024:</strong> <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11817971734">2h18m</a></p>
        <p>
            Here's a stupid story: one Friday at 6PM, on 4 hours of sleep, no 
            food, no water just coffee, no training 
            and angry for having done absolutely 
            no work, I went on a run. I was so pissed, that 3 minutes into the run 
            I decided "hey! I should run a marathon! In a loop! In the woods!"
        </p>

        <p>
            8 miles later, I realized there was a 0% chance that I would make it 26.2 miles
            and opted for a half marathon: 13.1 miles. I somehow made it, 
            completing the half marathon in 2 hours and 18 minutes. 1 standard deviation 
            to the right for men. I'll take it for no training...
        </p>

        <p>
            Then I noticed something strange. I felt <strong>good</strong>.
            And the dopamine high
            didn't leave for 3 days. <strong>3 ENTIRE DAYS</strong>. Specifically, I was a monster 
            at work, putting in 16 hour days of focus without breaking a sweat. 
            I don't think I've ever been that productive without Princeton's Dean's 
            Date looming over my head.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, even though I don't like running, I think I'm obligated to try it 
            because I think I just found a cheat code to life and I must listen to
            my body. 
            I'm starting this logbook to 
            document my progression. I have no goal except
            to optimize my best half marathon time. As always, this logbook will be 
            in <strong>reverse chronological order</strong> so you don't need to scroll
            through my yapping to see how I'm doing. Let's do it!
        </p>

        <h2>27-07-2024: 38.2 miles logged</h2>
        <p>
            13.26 miles in 01:54.
            <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/11995083307">This PR brought to you by a ðŸ¥¥ ðŸŒ´</a>. 
            I ran calculations on dew point+body->outside temperature delta+energy 
            flux and found I would expend 10-15% less energy had I started my run at 5AM 
            when it was 70Â°F, instead of at 10AM, when it was 83Â°F. I 
            don't think pacing is as important. Other notes: food ran out around mile 9, and it hit
            like a freight train. Need more carbs the day before, maybe more water before the run. Otherwise,
            I might incorporate some deadlifts/pulls/abs Sunday and Wednesday to strengthen my posterior 
            chain - I slouch towards the end of my runs. That's all, I'm guessing sub 1:45 with the right 
            timing, more food, more water, and a stronger back. We will handle pacing another day.
        </p>

        <h2>26-07-2024: Thursday</h2>
        <p>
            Quick summary to explain where I'm at, and I'll be less wordy from here on out. 
            Few weeks of chill running, logging
            25 miles total since that run. I do this 4.2 mile run I call the "bong run"
            every once in a while. I've realized a couple crucial things about pacing
            and easing into a run so you're not fighting cold muscles. I'm attempting
            another halfie on Saturday after resting Friday, hopefully hitting sub 
            2 hours. The only adjustments I need to make to improve are: get sleep,
            hydrate, eat food the night before, and pace myself at sub 9:16 min/mi. 
            Can't believe Trump was almost assassinated, and also Kamala is the Dem
            nominee! Insanity right now. But I have no time to witness history: I'm 
            running too fast to notice hehe
